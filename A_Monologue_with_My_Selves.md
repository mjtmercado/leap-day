## What is Friendster’s impact on me as a communicator?
Well, let’s give credit to this platform for allowing me to learn how to engage in conversations with others. However, I think that, because of my very young age, the impact was detrimental.

As a communicator, it is essential that you engage in intrapersonal communication. Asking yourself questions about your identity matters because how you see yourself affects the way you present yourself. At a very young age, I did not know this. 

**I just focused on how to deliver, where to deliver, and when to deliver my message to persuade others and myself.**

I did not recognize the conflict it created within me.
Instead of inside to outside communication, it was the other way around.

The way others saw me and communicated with me influenced the way I talked to myself. This is why I think that, despite the communication opportunities given by this platform, I still believe that the way I was introduced to it and how I manipulated it led to a false representation of myself.

**What now?**

What if I represented myself different from who I really was?
You see, as a teenager, it really mattered. Until now, even though I can already decide for myself, and I do not depend on my sister anymore to set up my account, social media platforms are still significant contributors to how I perceive and present myself. This false representation did not end in Friendster. It happens on my Instagram and Facebook accounts.

### *Memory*
I was able to retrieve my photos from Friendster, and I like to show you **a promise of myself to my selves.**
