title: The Journey of My Selves
---

I think it was around 2008 when I was first introduced to Friendster. That time, I was only 12 years old, and my older sister was the one who created my email and helped me out setting up my account.

She told me to do this and that to ensure that my profile looks “chic.” Of course, as a twelve-year-old kid, I did not have much of an idea of how I should present myself.

This blog is about the journey of my selves.

I thought it is impossible to have many versions of yourself.

Not until now.
