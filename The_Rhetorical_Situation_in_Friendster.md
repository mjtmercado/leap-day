## The Exigence

I came from a low-income family, and I studied in a public school in grade school. My mother decided to enroll me in one of the most famous private schools in our city because that is where she works. The payment was just deducted from her monthly salary. Since I am not a rich kid, I had to identify myself as one. My classmates’ cellphones were the most recently released models. Their bags were branded. Their notebooks were expensive. Their parents were either doctors, engineers, or businessmen.

*I have to be like them.*
*I have to look cool."
*I have to belong.*
This was the exigence.

## The Process of Identifcation

Burke noted that in understanding identification, we must remember that we are actors who use language to create symbolic actions. We use language that has the purpose of conveying our attitudes. In the associating process of identification, we persuade others, or even ourselves, that we have commonalities that can be used to achieve cohesion.

Since Friendster was the most used digital platform during my high school years, it impacted me a lot as a communicator. I had to post content that will address the exigence I was experiencing that time. I had to make sure that my pictures and other posts would persuade others that I "belong" to the school. 

Unfortunately, I was not aware that the views and comments I got and the testimonials I received even magnified the exigence in this situation.  These rhetorical texts pushed me even more to identify myself-- someone different from who I truly was.
          
## The Rhetor and the Audience

I like Burke’s emphasis on identification as *semi-conscious and is achieved through self- persuasion*. 

I believe that these were evident in the identification I had experienced in my high school days. I was the rhetor, using Friendster and its features as tools to send rhetorical texts, but I was also the audience. 

I had to act upon myself rhetorically to fully persuade myself that I belong to that school, and I am one of the cool and rich kids. 

Burke used the idea of a parliament, which is composed of contrasting people, and in each situation, there is an assigned group that will persuade the others using language. 

In my case, I may have different versions of myself, but the one who persuaded the others is the pressured teenager who wants to be “in” of the group where she belongs. 

## The Constraints- Wait. What constraints?

During that time, I was not able to recognize the constraints. I was just starting to learn about my identity because, at that stage, role confusion was the major problem. I had to associate myself with other people and identify myself as someone else. Despite the difficulty of maintaining that posture and image, I had rationalized my choice to portray myself as someone different to address the exigence in that rhetorical situation.
